# 📊 Fake News Detection 🚨

## 🔍 Project Overview

Welcome to the **Fake News Detection** web application! This app allows users to input either a **news URL** or **raw text**, and the system will analyze the content to determine whether it is **fake** or **legitimate**. The app uses a **logistic regression model** trained on a labeled dataset containing both fake and real news to make its predictions.

With an impressive **accuracy of 99.01%**, this project is a great demonstration of the power of machine learning for natural language processing (NLP) tasks.

## 🤖 Model Overview

The project uses a **logistic regression model** trained on a dataset with both **fake** and **real** news content. It processes the text and provides predictions about the authenticity of the news. This model is persisted using **joblib** for seamless integration with the **Flask app**.

---

## 🌟 Features

- **URL Analysis**: Paste any URL, and the system will fetch the content and analyze its authenticity.
- **Text Analysis**: Paste raw news text, and get real-time classification.
- **Result Display**: View whether the news is fake or real with confidence scores.
- **Real-time Predictions**: Receive results instantly using Flask APIs.
- **Error Handling**: Invalid inputs or errors are handled with appropriate messages.

## 🛠 Installation and Setup

### Step 1: Create a Virtual Environment

1. **Create a Virtual Environment:**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   ```

2. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     .\venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

After activating the virtual environment, install all the required libraries listed in `requirements.txt`.

1. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## 🚀 How to Run the Application

1. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**

   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
   .\venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows
   ```

2. **Run the Flask Application:**

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

   The application will be hosted at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`. Open this URL in your browser to interact with the web interface.

---

## 🌐 API Endpoints

- **POST `/predict`**: Accepts a `text` parameter for text-based analysis.
- **POST `/analyze`**: Accepts a `url` parameter for URL-based analysis.

Both endpoints return a JSON response with the prediction and confidence score.
